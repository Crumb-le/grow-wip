			<p>Between the seams that line your living room<br>
A vine of ivy's pushing her way through<br>
And as she creeps along, she sinks her roots<br>
Into the cracks, and pulls 'em back until the structure's coming loose</p>

<p>And the way the shadows on the wall are cast<br>
Look like a twisted apparition from the past<br>
And all the memories come flooding fast<br>
A wilderness you kinda miss, but were taught you ought to cut it back</p>

<p>So you shut it out<br>
You shout it down<br>
Until you're all white-knuckled<br>
You got a lot to learn, if you'd settle down</p>

<p><span class="chorus-style">
Let be what is, let be what isn't<br>
It's a natural world in which we're living<br>
And if you let it alone, it will surely grow<br>
Just leave it alone, child, and let it go</span></p>

<p>And when all your ziggurats have crumbled down<br>
And every stone is thrown like seeds across the ground<br>
A new Arcadia will come around<br>
And multiply until the binds of death have been unwound</p>

<p>So don't you shut it out<br>
Don't you shout it down<br>
And get your feathers ruffled<br>
You got a lot to learn, if you'd just settle down<br>
And let the river run its course</p>

<p>'Cause see, the ground all around<br>
It was always holy<br>
Leave the ruins where they fall<br>
Leave them all<br>
And let the wild take over</p>

<p><span class="chorus-style">
Let be what is, let be what isn't<br>
It's a natural world in which we're living<br>
And if you let it alone, it will surely grow<br>
Just leave it alone, child, and let it go</span></p>

<p><span class="chorus-style">
Let be what is, let be what isn't<br>
It's a natural world in which we're living<br>
And if you let it alone, it will surely grow<br>
Just leave it alone, child, and let it go</span></p>
